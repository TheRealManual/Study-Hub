🎯 SIMPLIFIED STUDY HUB LAUNCHER

📁 You now have a cleaner setup with fewer confusing files!

🚀 START STUDY HUB.bat ⭐ 
   ↳ THIS IS THE MAIN ONE - Double-click this to study!
   ↳ Starts your study site and opens browser automatically

🔧 Other files (you probably won't need these):
   ↳ START_STUDY_HUB.bat - Alternative with logs (for troubleshooting)
   ↳ STOP_SERVER.bat - Emergency stop button (if server gets stuck)

🎯 FOR DAILY USE: 
Just double-click "START STUDY HUB.bat" and you're done!

💡 WHY MULTIPLE FILES?
I got excited and created backup options, but honestly you only need the main one 99% of the time. The others are just there "just in case" something goes wrong.

Sorry for the confusion! Just use the main "START STUDY HUB.bat" file! 😊
